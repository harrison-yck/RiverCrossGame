## Prerequisite
- jdk 16
- gradle 7.0

## How to use
- compile the project and run Main.class

## Note 
In this project, comment is seldomly used since if I think the code is clear enoug and comment can be too verbose for most of the cases.

In normal case, tests should be split by cases, but for simplicity, I put them together in rule tests.
